# Agent Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## 1.2.0 - 2021-06-28

### Added
- A '==' condition can now be used with comparing browser versions
- An extension to JenssegersAgent `version` function that now accepts the "simplify" param which will floor the unit to 0 decimal places. So browser versions like '91.0.4472.114' will be returned as '91'. This is disabled by default.

### Changed
- The Agent service now extrends JenssegersAgent utility correctly. Previously all methods and properties were being forwarded via a magic method which is completely unecessary. This should help significantly when trying to trace errors.

### Fixed
- [Issue 11](https://github.com/marknotton/craft-plugin-agent/issues/11) Fixed an error being thrown relating to how version units are handled when passed as a string.

### Updated
- The data() method was a clanky string concatenation that is now be handled more elegantly with Crafts own 'renderTagAttributes' HTML Helper.
- All instances where version numbers are compared, the native `version_compare` PHP method is used. 

###Â Removed
- Variables class. It wasn't needed and is managed correctly via the base init method. All variables are still accessible. 

## 1.1.8 - 2020-05-21

### Changed
- User agent exceptiones are now handled earlier on in the Services init method, rather than each time the 'Check' method is called.
- User agent matches will no longer return `true` during the 'Check' method, but instead uses [Jenssegers "setUserAgent"](https://github.com/jenssegers/agent#basic-usage) method to edit the user agent string to a fallback. The fallback defaults to a "Chrome 81 on Windows" string and be can modified in the agents config file. This will not amend your true browser User Agent, it only changes the user agent string referenced in this plugin. 
- *Breaking* Since version 1.1.7 - Adding custom user agent exceptions in the config file meant defining a 'checkExceptions' value. This is now renamed to 'userAgentExceptions'. 

### Updated
- The Javaacript class is now formatted to ES5 isntead of ES6. So the ES5 version has been removed. 
- The Javaacript classes viewport related methods are removed as they were not-inkeeping with the nature of this plugin. Only data-attribute querying methods remain.
- The Javaacript class is now IIFE instead of a Class.

## 1.1.7 - 2020-05-20

### Updated
- Composer dependency versions

### Added
- [Issue 7](https://github.com/marknotton/craft-plugin-agent/issues/7) - You can add bespoke user agents to a configs file which will allow the "Check" method to pass. This will help in circumstances where bots using uncommon agent strings were failing for one reason or the other.

### Fixed
- [Issue 6](https://github.com/marknotton/craft-plugin-agent/issues/6) - Empty user agents now return false.

- In some cases where the user agent version was 0 but the user agent name was corrent, the "check" method would return false. Also, when the version was 0 but the user agent name was incorrect the "check" method would returns true. This mixmatch of rules is now working as expected. 

## 1.1.6 - 2019-07-01

### Fixed
- There were circumstances where non-human traffic would throw an error because the 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' didn't exist.  

## 1.1.5 - 2019-03-20

### Fixed
- The new version of Googlebot (smartphone) emulates Chrome 41, which shouldn't really be flagged as an unsupported browser given it's actually a bot. So there are now user agent exceptions (specifically tailored to Google for now) that will allow trusted bots to access the site regardless of version number or browser name. In a future update this will be manageable via the plugins settings.

## 1.1.4 - 2018-10-18

### Added
- ES5 Babelified agent.es5.js distribution file.

## 1.1.2 / 1.1.3 - 2018-10-11

### Fixed
- Redirect function breaks in cases where user agents versions can't be read. To avoid new browsers from being redirected incorrectly, we have to allow browsers coming back with versions 0 regardless of any other criteria.

## 1.1.1 - 2018-08-13

### Added

- Agent.js now includes a rudimentary check for touch devices.  

## 1.1.0 - 2018-07-19

### Changed
- Checks function has been completely rewritten. Instead of checking if criteria is not met, it now does the opposite. This is far more legible and should have been this way from the offset. It's also much quicker, and deals with far less faff.

## 1.0.8 - 2018-06-19

### Fixed
- Fixed a schema-versioning bug that's preventing the plugin from being able to install via the Plugin Store.
